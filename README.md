### Facilitation of Document Upload for Online Applications

**Problem Description:** As online citizen-centric applications have become ubiquitous, the need for uploading support documents like address proof, ID proof, etc. have become a common requirement. The process of scanning documents, resizing them to specified size, uploading to the online system, etc. are complicated for lay persons. In most cases, they need to waste considerable time, or take help from others, which make the system unfriendly. An application to support these needs to be developed which can be integrated with any Government or Government approved applications.

**Minimum Desired Outcome:** A mobile / web based application to be developed for scanning, resizing and uploading documents (as required) in a single flow. Should support taking the photo of the applicant instantly, resize as required and upload. The details / documents obtained are stored in the cloud securely. The application should intelligently support local languages. Provision to interface easily with any online application is necessary. The solution has to be highly secure and hack-proof.
